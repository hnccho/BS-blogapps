<h1>RSS And Atom In Action - Chapter 17 chat blogger example</h1>
<hr />

<p>An IRC chat robot that monitors an IRC channel. Anybody chatting in the 
channel can post to the chat robot's blog by starting a message with the 
nickname of the robot and using title: and content: strings using JSPWiki
syntaxt for the content. The robot also accepts an undo command (as long 
as it is issued within 30 seconds of last post.</p>

Here's an example interaction between user 'dave' and the 'blogbot'
<pre>
    dave: blogbot title: Test post 123 content: Some text in __bold__
    blogbot: Posted [AF63DF7760DAECC]
    dave: blogbot undo
    blogbot: Performing undo
</pre>

<h2>Build the example</h2>

<p>First, use Ant to build the example to the dist/chatblogger directory.</p>

For example on UNIX:
   <pre>
   $ cd $BLOGAPPS/java/ch17
   $ ant
   </pre>

Or on Windows:
   <pre>
   > cd %BLOGAPPS%\java\ch17
   > ant
   </pre>

<h2>Run the example</h2>

<p>To run the example and change directories into the dist/chatblogger
directory. Run the example using either ChatBlogger.bat (for Windows) 
or ChatBlogger.sh (for UNIX).</p>

For example on UNIX:
<pre>
   $ cd $BLOGAPPS/java/ch17/dist/chatblogger
   $ vi config.properties
   $ ./ChatBlogger.sh 
</pre>

Or on Windows:
<pre>
   > cd %BLOGAPPS%\java\ch17\dist\chatblogger
   > notepad config.properties
   > ChatBlogger
</pre>

<p>The vi and notepad lines are there because you will want to edit 
the config.properties file to set the IRC server name, IRC channel
name and blog connection parameters for the chatblogger robot.</p>

<p>As Chat Blogger starts up, it will print out some messages to let 
you know that it's healthy, for example:</p>

<pre>
   $ ./ChatBlogger.sh 
   Connected!
   Joined #testblog
</pre>

<p>You can exit Chat Blogger by sending it the exit command from within 
the chat room or by pressing CONTROL-C in the console window to terminate 
the process.</p>

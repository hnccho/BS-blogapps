<h1>RSS And Atom In Action - Chapter 18 filecaster example</h1>
<hr />

<p>Simple webapp that allows file upload and makes uploaded files available 
as podcasts.</p>

<h2>Build the example</h2>

<p>Use Ant to build the examples to the dist/filecaster directory. The build
script will compile the code and build the dist/filecaster.war, which is
ready for deployment.</p>

For example on UNIX:
   <pre>
   $ cd $BLOGAPPS/java/ch18
   $ ant
   </pre>

Or on Windows:
   <pre>
   > cd %BLOGAPPS%\java\ch18
   > ant
   </pre>

<h2>Deploy and run example</h2>

<p>The Chapter 18 examples are part of a Java web application called "filecaster".
To run filecaster, you must first deploy it to a Java web application server.
You can use the Blogapps demo server, which just a customized version of Tomcat.
To install to Tomcat or Blogapps server, just copy the filecaster WAR 
to the webapps directory.</p>

For example on UNIX (assuming Tomcat is installed in $TOMCAT):
   <pre>
   $ cd $BLOGAPPS/java/ch18/dist
   $ cp -r filecaster.war $TOMCAT/webapps
   </pre>

Or on Windows (assuming Tomcat is installed in %TOMCAT%:
   <pre>
   $ cd %BLOGAPPS%\java\ch18\dist
   $ copy filecaster.war %TOMCAT%\webapps
   </pre>

<p>If you're using Blogapps server, them use it's directory as the TOMCAT-DIR.</p>

<p>Next, start (or restart) Tomcat and then open http://localhost:8080/filecaster
in your browser to see the filecaster examples.</p>
